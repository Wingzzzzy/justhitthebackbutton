    <h1>Just hit the back button</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, anywhere online, whenever I or other people post anything, there has to be that one comment that goes like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Why did you make this? Its Horible. It makes me feel uncomfortable.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Well, you can simply hit the nice little back button on your web browser, 
      the back button on your Android phone, or the home button on an iPhone.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        B-but muh feelings?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>While your feelings about the content are valid, 
      advocating for censorship isn't the best solution. 
      Consider using the back button to navigate away if it's not to your liking
    </p>
 <!--   <p>
      This is bad form, for several reasons. What the person is
      <em>actually</em> asking here is,
      There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would
      not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think
      you're asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's
      confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other
      people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I
      have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way)
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it can be seen as..
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        I have a question about Java but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it
        in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to
        answer it
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ..which is just lazy. If you're not willing to do the work to solve your
      problem, why should we?
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling
      on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going on is
      unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question, but your actual
      problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, don't ask
      <em>"Any Java experts around?"</em>,
      but rather ask
      <em>"How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"</em>
